# Tracker Monthly Report

This is a progress update for 10/2024 on infrastructure provided by sudoblock including development of the tracker, indexer, and operation of RPC endpoints being used to support the ICON ecosystem.

### Summary

This month we saw a lot of activity on both the development side and infrastructure. On dev we worked through a major upgrade of the core packages that back all of our tooling including ORMs, webservers, and other core tooling. This caused changes across all of our repos but was needed as some incompatibilities were showing up. On the infrastructure side we finally completed the migration to bare metal and are now shutting off one of the cloud clusters. The other will remain on until new years after we do an upgrade to the nodes (add ram) and then the final migration will be complete.
