## Intro

*Please be sure to listen to each person's perspective when going through this process. The main goal is to work together effectively and create successes for the ecosystem and in general*

This is a project analysis of *Projects A,B,C,D,...* by *Group B*. This is useful to determine which projects may be good to fund

## Decision-making process

### Weighted Decision Matrix

A [weighted decision matrix](https://airfocus.com/blog/weighted-decision-matrix-prioritization/) is a form of [payoff matrix](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PayoffMatrix.html) for determining optimal decision strategies. It comes from ideas in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)

Listed are five criteria that are important to coming up with a decision. Associated with each critera is a weight 1-5 to note it's importance in the final decision. The selection of projects being analyzed are in the right-most columns. Each project is given a rating 1-5 for each criteria. In order to determine which project may be the best to fund, multiply the criteria weight by the score and add them up for each project. Feel free to adjust the weights to reflect your perspective. You may want to be prepared to justify this perspective as well

In this example, high weight and high score is favorable, similar to the common 'five-star' rating system

| Criteria | Criteria Weight | Project A | Project B | Project C | Project D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Impact on the Environment | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| Feasibility | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 |
| Cost | 5 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 2 |
| Timeframe | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| Innovation | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 2 |
| **Total Score** | - | **65** | **61** | **57** | **57** |

---
**From this process, we see that Project A is the best to fund, followed by Project B, C, then D**
